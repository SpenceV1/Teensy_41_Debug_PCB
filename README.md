# Teensy_41_Debug_PCB
Teensy 4.1 Debug PCB

This modification adds the ability to connect to a Teensy 4.1 device over JTAG with a Segger J-Link Debug Probe.

This PCB is only for the newest Teensy 4.1 with the GD32 bootloader chip.

The previous method has been depreciated, keeping the bootloader chip in place has proven to be much easier.
